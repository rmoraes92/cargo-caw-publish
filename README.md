# cargo-caw-publish (checksum aware wrapper publish)
A thin wrapper around `cargo publish` that verifies if a crate is
publishable taking on account both version string and checksum.


## Install

`cargo install cargo-caw-publish`


## Usage

- if you don't a crate/package name it will be assumed you want to process
the Cargo.toml file at the root of the current folder.

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish
```

- if passing crate/package name it will be assumed you want to process
a Cargo.toml file at <package_name>/Cargo.toml

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish <package_name>
```

- if you need to pass extra arguments for the "cargo package" phase

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish --package-args="--allow-dirty --keep-going"
```

- if you need to pass extra arguments for the "cargo publish" phase

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish --publish-args="--all-features --keep-going"
```
