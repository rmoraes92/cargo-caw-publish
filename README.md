# cargo-caw-publish (checksum aware wrapper publish)
A thin wrapper around `cargo publish` that verifies if a crate is
publishable taking on account both version string and checksum.


## Install

`cargo install cargo-caw-publish`


## Usage

- verify the Cargo.toml file at the root of the current folder.

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish
```

- verify the Cargo.toml file at a path `<package_name>/Cargo.toml`

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish <package_name>
```

- pass extra arguments for the "cargo package" phase

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish --package-args="--allow-dirty --keep-going"
```

- pass extra arguments for the "cargo publish" phase

```bash
$ cargo caw-publish --publish-args="--all-features --keep-going"
```

## Outputs

Let's say our latest release was the version 1.2.3. So:

- when you try to re-run publish with the same version we will return
(exit code 0):

```
the version <ver_string> is already published at the remote registry. nothing
to do here.
```

- when you change some code and forgets to update the version string we will
return (exit code 1):

```
the version <ver_string> is already published at the remote registry but your
local .crate checksum differs from the one on the remote:
local : <hash-a>
remote: <hash-b>
hint: maybe you forgot to update the version at <ver_string>!?
```
